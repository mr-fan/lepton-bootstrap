lepton-bootstrap
================

Backend Template for Lepton 2.x - using Twitter Bootstrap 3.x

###no support for Lepton 1.x versions

##known problems

- Change page sections (with JS drag and Drop the Up and Down Arrows wont work properly) ??
- some Problems with Admintools Backens CSS like in Dropleps may they could corrected with a /backend/admintoolname/backend.css 
  for the lepton_bootstrap Theme (Didn't know the state of devellopment of this Lepton feature until now)


## Special Features (until now)

- Get ripped of the most layout tables
- Using CSS Framework from Twitter Bootstrap <http://getbootstrap.com>
- Using iconfont <http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome> for UI
- Special admintoolicons possible to setup via the theme.css (look at the CSS file <https://github.com/mr-fan/lepton-bootstrap/blob/master/css/theme.css>)
- Using modals, tooltips, popovers and some other jquery stuff for easy additional content like helpmodal for editors
- codecleaning and first HTML5/CSS3 Admintheme (not finished yet)
- Change fast the complete look and feel with som of patterns from <http://www.subtlepatterns.com> (look at the login.css file <https://github.com/mr-fan/lepton-bootstrap/blob/master/css/login.css>)
- Automatic added Button CSS classes to input[type=submit] and input[type=reset] so all look the same way - Admintools and Wysiwygsections Save and Resets, too.
- little jQuery eqal high script added for some needed cases
